        <h2>Reading!</h2>
        <p>I really love reading books because they increase our knowledge and make us smarter. Some books are very fun, and some which might not raise our IQ but they expand our imagination. My favorite genres are fantasy, mystery and adventure. My favorite book series are Harry Potter, The Misadventures of Max Crumbly, Heroes in Training, Grimmtastic Girls and Goddess Girls!</p>
